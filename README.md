# WinkAtHome
C# Web Application to control your Wink Hub and Devices via the Wink/Quirky API

Before first use, change the projects settings to enter your own username and password.
****In the future, this will most likely be changed from static values to login credentials****

Right-Click the WinkAtHome project (not solution) and choose Properties.
Click on Settings.
Change the values of "winkUsername" & "winkPassword" to match what you use when you log into the Wink app.


For now, this is geared towards lights and locks.  Simple On/Off type devices.  As it expands, I will be adding in controls for Robots (turning them on and off), sensors, thermostats, and other, more complicated devices.
